# Slack Welcome Bot

A bot I built for my robotics team's Slack that welcomes users. 

Designed to run on [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com/)

*Note:* The welcome message must be stored in the `WELCOME_MESSAGE` environment variable, and the bot's name must be stored in the `SLACK_NAME` environment variable.
